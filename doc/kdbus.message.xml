    <para>
      A kdbus message is used to exchange information between two connections
      on a bus, or to transport notifications from the kernel to one or many
      connections. This document describes the layout of messages, how payload
      is added to them and how they are sent and received.

    <title>Message payload</title>

    <para>
      When connecting to the bus, receivers request a memory pool of a given
      size, large enough to carry all backlog of data enqueued for the
      connection. The pool is internally backed by a shared memory file which
      can be <function>mmap()</function>ed by the receiver. See
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>kdbus.pool</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>
      for more information.
    </para>

    <para>
      Message payload must be described in items attached to a message when
      it is sent. A receiver can access the payload by looking at the items
      that are attached to a message in its pool. The following items are used.
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><constant>KDBUS_ITEM_PAYLOAD_VEC</constant></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This item references a piece of memory on the sender side which is
            directly copied into the receiver's pool. This way, two peers can
            exchange data by effectively doing a single-copy from one process
            to another; the kernel will not buffer the data anywhere else.
            This item is never found in a message received by a connection.

        <term><constant>KDBUS_ITEM_PAYLOAD_OFF</constant></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            This item is attached to messages on the receiving side and points
            to a memory area inside the receiver's pool. The
            <varname>offset</varname> variable in the item denotes the memory
            location relative to the message itself.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Messages can reference <emphasis>memfd</emphasis> files which
            contain the data. memfd files are tmpfs-backed files that allow
            sealing of the content of the file, which prevents all writable
            access to the file content.
          </para>
          <para>
            Only memfds that have
            <constant>(F_SEAL_SHRINK|F_SEAL_GROW|F_SEAL_WRITE|F_SEAL_SEAL)
            </constant>
            set are accepted as payload data, which enforces reliable passing of
            data. The receiver can assume that neither the sender nor anyone
            else can alter the content after the message is sent. If those
            seals are not set on the memfd, the ioctl will fail with
            <errorcode>-1</errorcode>, and <varname>errno</varname> will be
            set to <constant>ETXTBUSY</constant>.
          </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Messages can transport regular file descriptors via
            <constant>KDBUS_ITEM_FDS</constant>. This item carries an array
            of <type>int</type> values in <varname>item.fd</varname>. The
            maximum number of file descriptors in the item is
            <constant>253</constant>, and only one item of this type is
            accepted per message. All passed values must be valid file
            descriptors; the open count of each file descriptors is increased
            by installing it to the receiver's task. This item can only be
            used for directed messages, not for broadcasts, and only to
            remote peers that have opted-in for receiving file descriptors
            at connection time (<constant>KDBUS_HELLO_ACCEPT_FD</constant>).
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>
      The sender must not make any assumptions on the type in which data is
      received by the remote peer. The kernel is free to re-pack multiple
      <constant>KDBUS_ITEM_PAYLOAD_VEC</constant> and
      <constant>KDBUS_ITEM_PAYLOAD_MEMFD</constant> payloads. For instance, the
      kernel may decide to merge multiple <constant>VECs</constant> into a
      single <constant>VEC</constant>, inline <constant>MEMFD</constant>
      payloads into memory, or merge all passed <constant>VECs</constant> into a
      single <constant>MEMFD</constant>. However, the kernel preserves the order
      of passed data. This means that the order of all <constant>VEC</constant>
      and <constant>MEMFD</constant> items is not changed in respect to each
      other. In other words: All passed <constant>VEC</constant> and
      <constant>MEMFD</constant> data payloads are treated as a single stream
      of data that may be received by the remote peer in a different set of
      chunks than it was sent as.

    <title>Sending messages</title>

    <para>
      Messages are passed to the kernel with the
      <constant>KDBUS_CMD_SEND</constant> ioctl. Depending on the destination
      address of the message, the kernel delivers the message to the specific
      destination connection, or to some subset of all connections on the same
      bus. Sending messages across buses is not possible. Messages are always
      queued in the memory pool of the destination connection (see above).
    </para>

    <para>
      The <constant>KDBUS_CMD_SEND</constant> ioctl uses a
      <type>struct kdbus_cmd_send</type> to describe the message
      transfer.
    </para>
    <programlisting>
struct kdbus_cmd_send {
  __u64 size;

  __u64 return_flags;

                <para>
                  By default, all calls to kdbus are considered asynchronous,
                  non-blocking. However, as there are many use cases that need
                  to wait for a remote peer to answer a method call, there's a
                  way to send a message and wait for a reply in a synchronous
                  fashion. This is what the
                  <constant>KDBUS_SEND_SYNC_REPLY</constant> controls. The
                  <constant>KDBUS_CMD_SEND</constant> ioctl will block until the
                  reply has arrived, the timeout limit is reached, in case the
                  remote connection was shut down, or if interrupted by a signal
                  before any reply; see
                  <citerefentry>

                  </citerefentry>.

                  The offset of the reply message in the sender's pool is stored
                  in in <varname>offset_reply</varname> when the ioctl has
                  returned without error. Hence, there is no need for another
                  <constant>KDBUS_CMD_RECV</constant> ioctl or anything else to
                  receive the reply.

                  is set to <constant>EPROTO</constant>.
                  Once the ioctl returned, the <varname>flags</varname>
                  field will have all bits set that the kernel recognizes as
                  valid for this command.
                  The <constant>KDBUS_FLAG_NEGOTIATE</constant> bit will be
