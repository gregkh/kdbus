    <title>Description</title>

    <para>
      Connections are identified by their <emphasis>connection ID</emphasis>,
      internally implemented as a <type>uint64_t</type> counter.
      The IDs of every newly created bus start at <constant>1</constant>, and
      every new connection will increment the counter by <constant>1</constant>.
      The IDs are not reused.
    </para>
    <para>
      In higher level tools, the user visible representation of a connection is
      defined by the D-Bus protocol specification as
      <constant>":1.&lt;ID&gt;"</constant>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Messages with a specific <type>uint64_t</type> destination ID are
      directly delivered to the connection with the corresponding ID. Signal
      messages (see
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>kdbus.message</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>)
      may be addressed to the special destination ID
      <constant>KDBUS_DST_ID_BROADCAST</constant> (~0ULL) and will then
      potentially be delivered to all currently active connections on the bus.
      However, in order to receive any signal messages, clients must subscribe
      to them by installing a match (see
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>kdbus.match</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>
      ).
    </para>
    <para>
      Messages synthesized and sent directly by the kernel will carry the
      special source ID <constant>KDBUS_SRC_ID_KERNEL</constant> (0).
    </para>
    <para>
      In addition to the unique <type>uint64_t</type> connection ID,
      established connections can request the ownership of
      <emphasis>well-known names</emphasis>, under which they can be found and
      addressed by other bus clients. A well-known name is associated with one
      and only one connection at a time. See
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>kdbus.name</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>
      on name acquisition, the name registry, and the validity of names.
    </para>
    <para>
      Messages can specify the special destination ID
      <constant>KDBUS_DST_ID_NAME</constant> (0) and carry a well-known name
      in the message data. Such a message is delivered to the destination
      connection which owns that well-known name.

    <title>Privileged connections</title>
    <para>
      A connection is considered <emphasis>privileged</emphasis> if the user
      it was created by is the same that created the bus, or if the creating
      task had <constant>CAP_IPC_OWNER</constant> set when it called
      <constant>KDBUS_CMD_HELLO</constant> (see below).
    </para>
    <para>
      Privileged connections have permission to employ certain restricted
      functions and commands, which are explained below and in other kdbus
      man-pages.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Activator and policy holder connection</title>
    <para>
      An <emphasis>activator</emphasis> connection is a placeholder for a
      <emphasis>well-known name</emphasis>. Messages sent to such a connection
      can be used to start an implementer connection, which will then get all
      the messages from the activator copied over. An activator connection
      cannot be used to send any message.
    </para>
    <para>
      A <emphasis>policy holder</emphasis> connection only installs a policy
      for one or more names. These policy entries are kept active as long as
      the connection is alive, and are removed once it terminates. Such a
      policy connection type can be used to deploy restrictions for names that
      are not yet active on the bus. A policy holder connection cannot be used
      to send any message.
    </para>
    <para>
      The creation of activator or policy holder connections is restricted to
      privileged users on the bus (see above).

  <refsect1>
    <title>Monitor connections</title>
    <para>
      Monitors are eavesdropping connections that receive all the traffic on the
      bus, but is invisible to other connections. Such connections have all
      properties of any other, regular connection, except for the following
      details:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        They will get every message sent over the bus, both unicasts and

        Installing matches for signal messages is neither necessary

      <listitem><para>

    <title>Creating connections</title>
    <para>
      A connection to a bus is created by opening an endpoint file (see

        <refentrytitle>kdbus.endpoint</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>7</manvolnum>

      of a bus and becoming an active client with the
      <constant>KDBUS_CMD_HELLO</constant> ioctl. Every connection has a unique
      identifier on the bus and can address messages to every other connection
      on the same bus by using the peer's connection ID as the destination.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <constant>KDBUS_CMD_HELLO</constant> ioctl takes a <type>struct
      kdbus_cmd_hello</type> as argument.

    <title>Termination of connections</title>
    <para>
      A connection can be terminated by simply calling
      <citerefentry>
        <refentrytitle>close</refentrytitle>
        <manvolnum>2</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry>
      on its file descriptor. All pending incoming messages will be discarded,
      and the memory allocated by the pool will be freed.
    </para>

    <para>
      An alternative way of closing down a connection is via the
      <constant>KDBUS_CMD_BYEBYE</constant> ioctl. This ioctl will succeed only
      if the message queue of the connection is empty at the time of closing;
      otherwise, the ioctl will fail with <varname>errno</varname> set to
      <constant>EBUSY</constant>. When this ioctl returns
      successfully, the connection has been terminated and won't accept any new
      messages from remote peers. This way, a connection can be terminated
      race-free, without losing any messages. The ioctl takes an argument of
      type <type>struct kdbus_cmd</type>.
