D-Bus is a system for powerful, easy to use interprocess communication (IPC).

The focus of this document is an overview of the low-level, native kernel D-Bus
transport called kdbus. Kdbus in the kernel acts similar to a device driver,
all communication between processes take place over special character device
nodes in /dev/kdbus/.

marshaling, and the communication semantics, please refer to:

1. Terminology
===============================================================================

  Item:
    The API of kdbus implements a notion of items, submitted through and
    returned by most ioctls, and stored inside data structures in the
    connection's pool. See section 4 for more details.

  Domain:
    A domain is a named object containing a number of buses. A system
    container that contains its own init system and users usually also
    runs in its own kdbus domain. The /dev/kdbus/domain/<container-name>/
    directory shows up inside the domain as /dev/kdbus/. Every domain offers
    its own "control" device node to create new buses or new sub-domains.
    Domains have no connection to each other and cannot see nor talk to
    each other. See section 5 for more details.

  Bus:
    A bus is a named object inside a domain. Clients exchange messages
    over a bus. Multiple buses themselves have no connection to each other;
    messages can only be exchanged on the same bus. The default entry point to
    a bus, where clients establish the connection to, is the "bus" device node
    /dev/kdbus/<bus name>/bus.
    Common operating system setups create one "system bus" per system, and one
    "user bus" for every logged-in user. Applications or services may create
    their own private named buses. See section 5 for more details.

  Endpoint:
    An endpoint provides the device node to talk to a bus. Opening an
    endpoint creates a new connection to the bus to which the endpoint belongs.
    Every bus has a default endpoint called "bus".
    A bus can optionally offer additional endpoints with custom names to
    provide a restricted access to the same bus. Custom endpoints carry
    additional policy which can be used to give sandboxed processes only
    a locked-down, limited, filtered access to the same bus.
    See section 5 for more details.

  Connection:
    A connection to a bus is created by opening an endpoint device node of
    a bus and becoming an active client with the HELLO exchange. Every
    connected client connection has a unique identifier on the bus and can
    address messages to every other connection on the same bus by using
    the peer's connection id as the destination.
    See section 6 for more details.

  Well-known Name:
    A connection can, in addition to its implicit unique connection id, request
    the ownership of a textual well-known name. Well-known names are noted in
    reverse-domain notation, such as com.example.service1. Connections offering
    a service on a bus are usually reached by its well-known name. The analogy
    of connection id and well-known name is an IP address and a DNS name
    associated with that address.

  Message:
    Connections can exchange messages with other connections by addressing
    the peers with their connection id or well-known name. A message consists
    of a message header with kernel-specific information on how to route the
    message, and the message payload, which is a logical byte stream of
    arbitrary size. Messages can carry additional file descriptors to be passed
    from one connection to another. Every connection can specify which set of
    metadata the kernel should attach to the message when it is delivered
    to the receiving connection. Metadata contains information like: system
    timestamps, uid, gid, tid, proc-starttime, well-known-names, process comm,
    process exe, process argv, cgroup, capabilities, seclabel, audit session,
    loginuid and the connection's human-readable name.
    See section 7 for more details.

  Broadcast and Match:
    Broadcast messages are potentially sent to all connections of a bus. By
    default, the connections will not actually receive any of the sent
    broadcast messages; only after installing a match for specific message
    properties, a broadcast message passes this filter.
    See section 10 for more details.

  Policy:
    Buses and custom endpoints can upload a set of policy rules, defining who
    can see, talk to, or register a well-know name on the bus. The policy is
    uploaded by the owner of the bus or the custom endpoint. Access rules to
    allow who can see a name on the bus are only checked on custom endpoints.
    Policies may be defined with names that end with '.*'. When matching a
    well-known name against such a wildcard entry, the last part of the name
    is ignored and checked against the wildcard name without the trailing '.*'.
    See section 11 for more details.

  Privileged bus users:
    A user connecting to the bus is considered privileged if it is either the
    creator of a bus, of if it has CAP_IPC_OWNER capability flag set.


2. Device Node Layout
===============================================================================

The kdbus interface is exposed through device nodes in /dev.

  /sys/bus/kdbus
  `-- devices
    |-- kdbus!0-system!bus -> ../../../devices/virtual/kdbus/kdbus!0-system!bus
    |-- kdbus!2702-user!bus -> ../../../devices/virtual/kdbus/kdbus!2702-user!bus
    |-- kdbus!2702-user!ep.app -> ../../../devices/virtual/kdbus/kdbus!2702-user!ep.app
    `-- kdbus!control -> ../../../devices/kdbus!control

  /dev/kdbus
  |-- control
  |-- 0-system
  |   |-- bus
  |   `-- ep.apache
  |-- 1000-user
  |   `-- bus
  |-- 2702-user
  |   |-- bus
  |   `-- ep.app
  `-- domain
      |-- fedoracontainer
      |   |-- control
      |   |-- 0-system
      |   |   `-- bus
      |   `-- 1000-user
      |       `-- bus
      `-- mydebiancontainer
          |-- control
          `-- 0-system
              `-- bus

Note:
  The device node subdirectory layout is arranged that a future version of
  kdbus could be implemented as a file system with a separate instance mounted
  for each domain. For any future changes, this always needs to be kept
  in mind. Also the dependency on udev's userspace hookups or sysfs attribute
  use should be limited to the absolute minimum for the same reason.

4. Items
===============================================================================

To flexibly augment transport structures used by kdbus, data blobs of type
struct kdbus_item are used. An item has a fixed-sized header that only stores
the type if the item and the overall size. The total size is variable and is
in some cases defined by the item type, in other cases can be of arbitrary
length (for instance, a string).

In the external kernel API, items are used for many ioctls to transport
optional information from userspace to kernelspace. They are also used for
information stored in a connection's pool, such as messages, name lists or
requested connection information.

In all such occasions where items are used as part of the kdbus kernel API,
they are embedded in structs that have an overall size of their own, so there
can be many of them.

The kernel expects all item to be aligned to 8-byte boundaries.

A simple iterator in userspace would iterate over the items until the items
have reached the embedding structure's overall size.


5. Creation of new domains, buses and endpoints
===============================================================================
The initial kdbus domain is unconditionally created by the kernel module. A
domain contains a "control" device node which allows to create a new bus or
domain. New domains do not have any buses created by default.


5.1 Domains and buses
---------------------

Opening the control device node returns a file descriptor, it accepts the
ioctls KDBUS_CMD_BUS_MAKE/KDBUS_CMD_DOMAIN_MAKE which specify the name of the
new bus or domain to create. The control file descriptor needs to be kept open
for the entire life-time of the created bus or domain, closing it will
immediately cleanup the entire bus or domain and all its associated
resources and connections. Every control file descriptor can only be used once
to create a new bus or domain; from that point, it is not used for any
further communication until the final close().

5.2 Endpoints
-------------

Endpoints are entry points to a bus. By default, each bus has a default
endpoint called 'bus'. The bus owner has the ability to create custom
endpoints with specific names, permissions, and policy databases (see below).

To create a custom endpoint, use the KDBUS_CMD_EP_MAKE ioctl with struct
kdbus_cmd_make. Custom endpoints always have a policy db that, by default,
does not allow anything. Everything that users of this new endpoint should be
able to do has to be explicitly specified through KDBUS_ITEM_NAME and
KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS items.


5.3 Creating domains, buses and endpoints
-----------------------------------------

KDBUS_CMD_BUS_MAKE, KDBUS_CMD_DOMAIN_MAKE and KDBUS_CMD_EP_MAKE take a struct
kdbus_cmd_make argument.

struct kdbus_cmd_make {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct, including its items.

  __u64 flags;
    The flags for creation.

    KDBUS_MAKE_ACCESS_GROUP
      Make the device node group-accessible

    KDBUS_MAKE_ACCESS_WORLD
      Make the device node world-accessible

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
    A list of items, only used for creating custom endpoints. Ignored for
    buses and domains.
};


6. Connections
===============================================================================


6.1 Connection IDs and well-known connection names
--------------------------------------------------

Connections are identified by their connection id, internally implemented as a
uint64_t counter. The IDs of every newly created bus start at 1, and every new
connection will increment the counter by 1. The ids are not reused.

In higher level tools, the user visible representation of a connection is
defined by the D-Bus protocol specification as ":1.<id>".

Messages with a specific uint64_t destination id are directly delivered to
the connection with the corresponding id. Messages with the special destination
id KDBUS_DST_ID_BROADCAST are broadcast messages and are potentially delivered
to all known connections on the bus; clients interested in broadcast messages
need to subscribe to the specific messages they are interested though, before
any broadcast message reaches them.

Messages synthesized and sent directly by the kernel, will carry the special
source id 0.

In addition to the unique uint64_t connection id, established connections can
request the ownership of well-known names, under which they can be found and
addressed by other bus clients. A well-known name is associated with one and
only one connection at a time.

Messages can specify the special destination id 0 and carry a well-known name
in the message data. Such a message is delivered to the destination connection
which owns that well-known name.

6.2 Creating connections
------------------------

A connection to a bus is created by opening an endpoint device node of
a bus and becoming an active client with the KDBUS_CMD_HELLO ioctl. Every
connected client connection has a unique identifier on the bus and can
address messages to every other connection on the same bus by using
the peer's connection id as the destination.

The KDBUS_CMD_HELLO ioctl takes the following struct as argument.

struct kdbus_cmd_hello {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct, including all attached items.

  __u64 conn_flags;
    Flags to apply to this connection:

    KDBUS_HELLO_ACCEPT_FD
      When this flag is set, the connection can be sent file descriptors
      as message payload. If it's not set, any attempt of doing so will
      result in -ECOMM on the sender's side.

    KDBUS_HELLO_ACTIVATOR
      Make this connection an activator (see below). With this bit set,
      an item of type KDBUS_ITEM_NAME has to be attached which describes
      the well-known name this connection should be an activator for.

    KDBUS_HELLO_POLICY_HOLDER
      Make this connection a policy holder (see below). With this bit set,
      an item of type KDBUS_ITEM_NAME has to be attached which describes
      the well-known name this connection should hold a policy for.

    KDBUS_HELLO_MONITOR
      Make this connection an eaves-dropping connection that receives all
      messages sent on the bus. This flag is only valid for privileged bus
      connections.

  __u64 attach_flags;
      Request the attachment of metadata for each message received by this
      connection. The metadata actually attached may actually augment the list
      of requested items.

  __u64 bus_flags;
      Upon successful completion of the ioctl, this member will contain the
      flags of the bus it connected to.

  __u64 id;
      Upon successful completion of the ioctl, this member will contain the
      id of the new connection.

  __u64 pool_size;
      The size of the communication pool, in bytes. The pool can be accessed
      by calling mmap() on the file descriptor that was used to issue the
      KDBUS_CMD_HELLO ioctl.

  struct kdbus_bloom_parameter bloom;
      Bloom filter parameter (see below).

  __u8 id128[16];
      Upon successful completion of the ioctl, this member will contain the
      128 bit wide UUID of the connected bus.

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
      Variable list of items to add optional additional information. The
      following items are currently expected/valid:

      KDBUS_ITEM_CONN_NAME
        Contains a string to describes this connection's name, so it can be
        identified later.

      KDBUS_ITEM_NAME
      KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS
        For activators and policy holders only, combinations of these two
        items describe policy access entries (see section about policy db).

      Items of other types are silently ignored.
};


6.3 Activator and policy holder connection
------------------------------------------

An activator connection is placeholders for a well-known name. Messages sent
to such a connection can be used by userspace to start an implementor
connection, which will then get all the messages from the activator copied
over. An activator connection cannot be used to send any message.

A policy holder connection only installs a policy for one or more names.
These policy entries are kept active as long as the connection is alive, and
are removed once it terminates. Such a policy connection type can be used to
deploy restrictions for names that are not yet in active on the bus. A policy
holder connection cannot be used to send any message.

The creation of activator, policy holder or monitor connections is an operation
restricted to privileged users on the bus (see section "Terminology").


6.4 Retrieving information on a connection
------------------------------------------

The KDBUS_CMD_CONN_INFO ioctl can be used to retrieve credentials and
properties of the initial creator of a connection. This ioctl uses the
following struct:

struct kdbus_cmd_conn_info {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct, including the name with its 0-byte string
    terminator.

  __u64 flags;
    Specify which items should be attached to the answer.
    The following flags can be used:

    KDBUS_ATTACH_NAMES
      Add an item to the answer containing all the names the connection
      currently owns.

    KDBUS_ATTACH_CONN_NAME
      Add an item to the answer containing the connection's name.

    After the ioctl returns, this field will contain the current metadata
    attach flags of the connection.

  __u64 id;
    The connection's numerical ID to retrieve information for. If set to
    non-zero value, the 'name' field is ignored.

  __u64 offset;
    When the ioctl returns, this value will yield the offset of the connection
    information inside the caller's pool.

  char name[0];
    The name of the connection to retrieve information for. Only looked at if
    the 'id' field is set to 0.
};

After the ioctl returns, the following struct  will be stored in the caller's
pool at 'offset'.

struct kdbus_conn_info {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct, including all its items.

  __u64 id;
    The connection's unique ID.

  __u64 flags;
    The connection's flags as specified when it was created.

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
    Depending on the 'flags' field in struct kdbus_cmd_conn_info, items of
    types KDBUS_ITEM_NAME and KDBUS_ITEM_CONN_NAME are followed here.
};

Once the caller is finished with parsing the return buffer, it needs to call
KDBUS_CMD_FREE for the offset.


6.5 Updating connection details
-------------------------------

Some of a connection's details can be updated with the KDBUS_CMD_CONN_UPDATE
ioctl, using the file descriptor that was used to create the connection.
The update command uses the following struct.

struct kdbus_cmd_update {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct, including all its items.

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
    Items to describe the connection details to be updated. The following item
    types are supported:

    KDBUS_ITEM_ATTACH_FLAGS
      Supply a new set of items to be attached to each message.

    KDBUS_ITEM_NAME
    KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS
      Policy holder connections may supply a new set of policy information
      with these items. For other connection types, -ENOTSUPP is returned.
};


6.6 Termination
---------------

A connection can be terminated by simply closing the file descriptor that was
used to start the connection. All pending messages will be discarded, and the
memory in the pool will be freed.

An alternative way of way of closing down a connection is calling the
KDBUS_CMD_BYEBYE ioctl on it, which will only succeed if the message queue
of the connection is empty at the time of closing, otherwise, -EBUSY is
returned.

When this ioctl returns successfully, the connection has been terminated and
won't accept any new messages from remote peers. This way, a connection can
be terminated race-free, without losing any messages.


7. Messages
===============================================================================

Messages consist of a fixed-size header followed directly by a list of
variable-sized data 'items'. The overall message size is specified in the
header of the message. The chain of data items can contain well-defined
message metadata fields, raw data, references to data, or file descriptors.


7.1 Sending messages
--------------------

Messages are passed to the kernel with the KDBUS_CMD_MSG_SEND ioctl. Depending
on the the destination address of the message, the kernel delivers the message
to the specific destination connection or to all connections on the same bus.
Sending messages across buses is not possible. Messages are always queued in
the memory pool of the destination connection (see below).

The KDBUS_CMD_MSG_SEND ioctl uses struct kdbus_msg to describe the message to
be sent.

struct kdbus_msg {
  __u64 size;
    The over all size of the struct, including the attached items.

  __u64 flags;
    Flags for message delivery:

    KDBUS_MSG_FLAGS_EXPECT_REPLY
      Expect a reply from the remote peer to this message. With this bit set,
      the timeout_ns field must be set to a non-zero number of nanoseconds in
      which the receiving peer is expected to reply. If such a reply is not
      received in time, the sender will be notified with a timeout message
      (see below).

      For a message to be accepted as reply, it must be a direct message to
      the original sender (not a broadcast), and its kdbus_msg.reply_cookie
      must match the previous message's kdbus_msg.cookie.

      Expected replies also temporarily open the policy of the sending
      connection, so the other peer is allowed to respond within the time
      given time window.

    KDBUS_MSG_FLAGS_SYNC_REPLY
      By default, all calls to kdbus are considered asynchronous,
      non-blocking. However, as there are many use cases that need to wait
      for a remote peer to answer a method call, there's a way to send a
      message and wait for a reply in a synchronous fashion. This is what
      the KDBUS_MSG_FLAGS_SYNC_REPLY controls. The KDBUS_CMD_MSG_SEND ioctl
      will block until the reply has arrived, the timeout limit is reached,
      or in case the remote connection was shut down.

      The offset of the reply message in the sender's pool is stored in
      in 'offset_reply' when the ioctl has returned without error. Hence,
      there is no need for another KDBUS_CMD_MSG_RECV ioctl or anything else
      to receive the reply.

    KDBUS_MSG_FLAGS_NO_AUTO_START
      By default, when a message is sent to an activator connection, the
      activator notified and will start an implementor. This flag inhibits
      that behavior. With this bit set, and the remote being an activator,
      -EADDRNOTAVAIL is returned from the ioctl.

  __s64 priority;
    The priority of this message. Receiving messages (see below) may
    optionally be constrained to messages of a minimal priority. This
    allows for use cases where timing critical data is interleaved with
    control data on the same connection.

  __u64 dst_id;
    The numeric ID of the destination connection, or KDBUS_DST_ID_BROADCAST
    to address every peer on the bus, or KDBUS_DST_ID_NAME to look it up
    dynamically from the bus' name registry. In the latter case, an item of
    type KDBUS_ITEM_DST_NAME is mandatory.

  __u64 src_id;
    Upon return of the ioctl, this member will contain the sending
    connection's numerical ID. Should be 0 at send time.

  __u64 payload_type;
    Type of the payload in the actual data records. Currently, only
    KDBUS_PAYLOAD_DBUS is accepted as input value of this field. When
    receiving messages that are generated by the kernel (notifications),
    this field will yield KDBUS_PAYLOAD_KERNEL.

  __u64 cookie;
    Cookie of this message, for later recognition. Also, when replying
    to a message (see above), the cookie_reply field must match this value.

  __u64 timeout_ns;
    If the message sent requires a reply from the remote peer (see above),
    this field contains the timeout in nanoseconds.

  __u64 cookie_reply;
    If the message sent is a reply to another message, this field must
    match the cookie of the formerly received message.

  __u64 offset_reply;
    If the message successfully got a synchronous reply (see above), this
    field will yield the offset of the reply message in the sender's pool.
    Is is what KDBUS_CMD_MSG_RECV usually does for asynchronous messages.

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
    An dynamically sized list of items to contain additional information.
    The following items are expected/valid:

    KDBUS_ITEM_PAYLOAD_VEC
    KDBUS_ITEM_PAYLOAD_MEMFD
    KDBUS_ITEM_FDS
      Actual data records containing the payload. See section "Passing of
      Payload Data".

    KDBUS_ITEM_BLOOM_FILTER
      Bloom filter for matches (see below).

    KDBUS_ITEM_DST_NAME
      Well-known name to send this message to. Required if dst_id is set
      to KDBUS_DST_ID_NAME. If a connection holding the given name can't
      be found, -ESRCH is returned.
};


7.2 Message layout
------------------

The layout of a message is shown below.

  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Message                                                                 |
  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
  | | Header                                                              | |
  | | size: overall message size, including the data records              | |
  | | destination: connection id of the receiver                          | |
  | | source: connection id of the sender (set by kernel)                 | |
  | | payload_type: "DBusDBus" textual identifier stored as uint64_t      | |
  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
  | | Data Record                                                         | |

  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
  | | padding bytes to the next 8 byte alignment                          | |
  | +---------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
  +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+


7.3 Passing of Payload Data
---------------------------

When connecting to the bus, receivers request a memory pool of a given size,
large enough to carry all backlog of data enqueued for the connection. The
pool is internally backed by a shared memory file which can be mmap()ed by
the receiver.

KDBUS_MSG_PAYLOAD_VEC:
  Messages are directly copied by the sending process into the receiver's pool,
  that way two peers can exchange data by effectively doing a single-copy from
  one process to another, the kernel will not buffer the data anywhere else.

KDBUS_MSG_PAYLOAD_MEMFD:
  Messages can reference memfd files which contain the data.
  memfd files are tmpfs-backed files that allow sealing of the content of the
  file, which prevents all writable access to the file content.
  Only sealed memfd files are accepted as payload data, which enforces
  reliable passing of data; the receiver can assume that the sender and nobody
  else can alter the content after the message is sent.

Apart from the sender filling-in the content into memfd files, the data will
be passed as zero-copy from one process to another, read-only, shared between
the peers.


7.4 Receiving messages
----------------------

Messages are received by the client with the KDBUS_CMD_MSG_RECV ioctl. The
endpoint device node of the bus supports poll() to wake up the receiving
process when new messages are queued up to be received.

With the KDBUS_CMD_MSG_RECV ioctl, a struct kdbus_cmd_recv is used.

struct kdbus_cmd_recv {
  __u64 flags;
    Flags to control the receive command.

    KDBUS_RECV_PEEK
      Just return the location of the next message. Do not install file
      descriptors or anything else. This is usually used to determine the
      sender of the next queued message.

    KDBUS_RECV_DROP
      Drop the next message without doing anything else with it, and free the
      pool slice. This a short-cut for KDBUS_RECV_PEEK and KDBUS_CMD_FREE.

    KDBUS_RECV_USE_PRIORITY
      Use the priority field (see below).

  __s64 priority;
      With KDBUS_RECV_USE_PRIORITY set in flags, receive the next message in
      the queue with at least the given priority. If no such message is waiting
      in the queue, -ENOMSG is returned.

  __u64 offset;
      Upon return of the ioctl, this field contains the offset in the
      receiver's memory pool.
};

Unless KDBUS_RECV_DROP was passed, and given that the ioctl succeeded, the
offset field contains the location of the new message inside the receiver's
pool. The message is stored as struct kdbus_msg at this offset, and can be
interpreted with the semantics described above.

The caller is obliged to call KDBUS_CMD_FREE with the returned offset when
the memory is no longer needed.


7.5 Canceling messages synchronously waiting for replies
--------------------------------------------------------

When a connection sends a message with KDBUS_MSG_FLAGS_SYNC_REPLY and
blocks while waiting for the reply, the KDBUS_CMD_MSG_CANCEL ioctl can be
used on the same file descriptor to cancel the message, based on its cookie.
If there are multiple messages with the same cookie that are all synchronously
waiting for a reply, all of them will be canceled.


8. Name registry
===============================================================================

Each bus instantiates a name registry to resolve well-known names into unique
connection IDs for message delivery. The registry will be queried when a
message is sent with kdbus_msg.dst_id set to KDBUS_DST_ID_NAME, or when a
registry dump is requested.

All of the below is subject to policy rules for SEE and OWN permissions.


8.1 Acquiring a name
--------------------

To acquire a name, a client uses the KDBUS_CMD_NAME_ACQUIRE ioctl with the
following data structure.

struct kdbus_cmd_name {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of this struct, including the name with its 0-byte string
    terminator.

  __u64 flags;
    Flags to control details in the name acquisition.

    KDBUS_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING
      Acquiring a name that is already present usually fails, unless this flag
      is set in the call, and KDBUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT or (see below) was
      set when the current owner of the name acquired it, or if the current
      owner is an activator connection (see below).

    KDBUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT
      Allow other connections to take over this name. When this happens, the
      former owner of the connection will be notified of the name loss.

    KDBUS_NAME_QUEUE (acquire)
      A name that is already acquired by a connection, and which wasn't
      requested with the KDBUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT flag set can not be
      acquired again. However, a connection can put itself in a queue of
      connections waiting for the name to be released. Once that happens, the
      first connection in that queue becomes the new owner and is notified
      accordingly.

  __u64 owner_id;
  __u64 conn_flags;
    Unused in this use case.

  char name[0];
    The name to acquire. Must be a valid bus name.
};


8.2 Releasing a name
--------------------

A connection may release a name explicitly with the KDBUS_CMD_NAME_RELEASE
ioctl. If the connection was an implementor of an activatable name, its
pending messages are moved back to the activator. If there are any connections
queued up as waiters for the name, the oldest one of them will become the new
owner. The same happens implicitly for all names once a connection terminates.

The KDBUS_CMD_NAME_RELEASE ioctl uses the same data structure as the
acquisition call, but with slightly different field usage.

struct kdbus_cmd_name {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of this struct, including the name with its 0-byte string
    terminator.

  __u64 flags;
  __u64 owner_id;
  __u64 conn_flags;
    All unused for this use case.

  char name[0];
    The name to release.
};


8.3 Dumping the name registry
-----------------------------

A connection may request a complete or filtered dump of currently active bus
names with the KDBUS_CMD_NAME_LIST ioctl, which takes a struct
kdbus_cmd_name_list as argument.

struct kdbus_cmd_name_list {
  __u64 flags;
    Any combination of flags to specify which names should be dumped.

    KDBUS_NAME_LIST_UNIQUE
      List the unique (numeric) IDs of the connection, whether it owns a name
      or not.

    KDBUS_NAME_LIST_NAMES
      List well-known names stored in the database which are actively owned by
      a real connection (not an activator).

    KDBUS_NAME_LIST_ACTIVATORS
      List names that are owned by an activator.

    KDBUS_NAME_LIST_QUEUED
      List connections that are not yet owning a name but are waiting for it
      to become available.

  __u64 offset;
    When the ioctl returns successfully, the offset to the name registry dump
    inside the connection's pool will be stored in this field.
};

The returned list of names is stored in a struct kdbus_name_list that in turn
contains a dynamic number of struct kdbus_cmd_name that carry the actual
information. The fields inside that struct kdbus_cmd_name is described next.

struct kdbus_cmd_name {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of this struct, including the name with its 0-byte string
    terminator.

  __u64 flags;
    The current flags for this name. Can be any combination of

    KDBUS_NAME_ALLOW_REPLACEMENT

    KDBUS_NAME_IN_QUEUE (list)
      When retrieving a list of currently acquired name in the registry, this
      flag indicates whether the connection actually owns the name or is
      currently waiting for it to become available.

    KDBUS_NAME_ACTIVATOR (list)
      An activator connection owns a name as a placeholder for an implementor,
      which is started on demand as soon as the first message arrives. There's
      some more information on this topic below. In contrast to
      KDBUS_NAME_REPLACE_EXISTING, when a name is taken over from an activator
      connection, all the messages that have been queued in the activator
      connection will be moved over to the new owner. The activator connection
      will still be tracked for the name and will take control again if the
      implementor connection terminates.
      This flag can not be used when acquiring a name, but is implicitly set
      through KDBUS_CMD_HELLO with KDBUS_HELLO_ACTIVATOR set in
      kdbus_cmd_hello.conn_flags.

  __u64 owner_id;
    The owning connection's unique ID.

  __u64 conn_flags;
    The flags of the owning connection.

  char name[0];
    The well-known name.
};

The returned buffer must be freed with the KDBUS_CMD_FREE ioctl when the user
is finished with it.


9. Notifications
===============================================================================

The kernel will notify its users of the following events.

  * When connection A is terminated while connection B is waiting for a reply
    from it, connection B is notified with a message with an item of type
    KDBUS_ITEM_REPLY_DEAD.

  * When connection A does not receive a reply from connection B within the
    specified timeout window, connection A will receive a message wit an item
    of type KDBUS_ITEM_REPLY_TIMEOUT.

  * When a connection is created on or removed from a bus, messages with an
    item of type KDBUS_ITEM_ID_ADD or KDBUS_ITEM_ID_REMOVE, respectively, are
    sent to all bus members that match these messages through their match
    database.

  * When a connection owns or loses a name, or a name is moved from one
    connection to another, messages with an item of type KDBUS_ITEM_NAME_ADD,
    KDBUS_ITEM_NAME_REMOVE or KDBUS_ITEM_NAME_CHANGE are sent to all bus
    members that match these messages through their match database.

A kernel notification is a regular kdbus message with the following details.

  * kdbus_msg.src_id == KDBUS_SRC_ID_KERNEL
  * kdbus_msg.dst_id == KDBUS_DST_ID_BROADCAST
  * kdbus_msg.payload_type == KDBUS_PAYLOAD_KERNEL
  * Has exactly one of the aforementioned items attached


10. Message Matching, Bloom filters
===============================================================================

10.1 Matches for broadcast messages
-----------------------------------

A message addressed at the connection ID 0 (KDBUS_DST_ID_BROADCAST) is a
broadcast message, delivered to all connected peers which installed a rule to
match certain properties of the message. Without any rules installed in the
connection, no broadcast message or kernel-side notifications will be delivered
to the connection.

Matches for messages from other connections (not kernel notifications) are
implemented as bloom filters. The sender adds certain properties of the message
as elements to a bloom filter bit field, and sends that along with the
broadcast message.

The connection adds the message properties it is interested as elements to a
bloom mask bit field, and uploads the mask to the match rules of the
connection.

The kernel will match the broadcast message's bloom filter against the
connections bloom mask (simply by &-ing it), and decide whether the message
should be delivered to the connection.

The kernel has no notion of any specific properties of the message, all it
sees are the bit fields of the bloom filter and mask to match against. The
use of bloom filters allows simple and efficient matching, without exposing
any message properties or internals to the kernel side. Clients need to deal
with the fact that they might receive broadcasts which they did not subscribe
to, as the bloom filter might allow false-positives to pass the filter.

To allow the future extension of the set of elements in the bloom filter, the
filter specifies a "generation" number. A later generation must always contain
all elements of the set of the previous generation, but can add new elements
to the set. The match rules mask can carry an array with all previous
generations of masks individually stored. When the filter and mask are matched
by the kernel, the mask with the closest matching "generation" is selected
as the index into the mask array.


10.2 Matches for kernel notifications
------------------------------------

To receive kernel generated notifications (see section 9), a connection must
install special match rules that are different from the bloom filter matches
described in the section before.


10.3 Adding a match
-------------------

To add a match, the KDBUS_CMD_MATCH_ADD ioctl is used, which takes a struct
of the following type.

struct kdbus_cmd_match {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct, including its items.

  __u64 cookie;
    A cookie which identifies the match, so it can be referred to at removal
    time.

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
    Items to define the actual match. The following item types are expected.

    KDBUS_ITEM_BLOOM_MASK
      An item that carries the bloom filter mask to match against in its
      data field. The payload size must match the bloom filter size that
      was specified when the bus was created.

    KDBUS_ITEM_NAME
    KDBUS_ITEM_ID

    KDBUS_ITEM_NAME_ADD
    KDBUS_ITEM_NAME_REMOVE
    KDBUS_ITEM_NAME_CHANGE
      These items request delivery of broadcast messages that describe a name
      acquisition, loss, or change. The details are stored in the item's
      kdbus_notify_name_change member. All information specified must be
      matched in order to make the message pass. Use KDBUS_MATCH_ID_ANY to
      match against any unique connection ID.

    KDBUS_ITEM_ID_ADD
    KDBUS_ITEM_ID_REMOVE
      These items request delivery of broadcast messages that are generated
      when a connection is created or terminated. struct kdbus_notify_id_change
      is used to store the actual match information. This item can be used to
      monitor one particular connection ID, or, when the id field is set to
      KDBUS_MATCH_ID_ANY, all of them.

    Other item types are ignored.
};


10.4 Removing a match
--------------------

Matches can be removed through the KDBUS_CMD_MATCH_REMOVE ioctl, which again
takes struct kdbus_cmd_match as argument, but its fields are used slightly
differently.

struct kdbus_cmd_match {
  __u64 size;
    The overall size of the struct. As it has no items in this use case, the
    value should yield 16.

  __u64 cookie;
    The cookie of the match, as it was passed when the match was added.
    All matches that have this cookie will be removed.

  struct kdbus_item items[0];
    Unused for this use case.
};


11. Policy
===============================================================================

A policy databases restrict the possibilities of connections to own, see and
talk to well-known names. It can be associated with a bus (through a policy
holder connection) or a custom endpoint.

By default, buses don't have a policy database but create one on demand as soon
as a policy holder connection is instantiated.

A set of policy rules is described by a name and multiple access rules, defined
by the following struct.

struct kdbus_policy_access {
  __u64 type;	/* USER, GROUP, WORLD */
    One of the following.

    KDBUS_POLICY_ACCESS_USER
      Grant access to a user with the uid stored in the 'id' field.

    KDBUS_POLICY_ACCESS_GROUP
      Grant access to a user with the gid stored in the 'id' field.

    KDBUS_POLICY_ACCESS_WORLD
      Grant access to everyone. The 'id' field is ignored.

  __u64 access;	/* OWN, TALK, SEE */
    The access to grant.

    KDBUS_POLICY_SEE
      Allow the name to be seen.

    KDBUS_POLICY_TALK
      Allow the name to be talked to.

    KDBUS_POLICY_OWN
      Allow the name to be owned.

  __u64 id;
    For KDBUS_POLICY_ACCESS_USER, stores the uid.
    For KDBUS_POLICY_ACCESS_GROUP, stores the gid.
};

Policies are set through KDBUS_CMD_HELLO (when creating a policy holder
connection), KDBUS_CMD_CONN_UPDATE (when updating a policy holder connection),
KDBUS_CMD_EP_MAKE (creating a custom endpoint) or KDBUS_CMD_EP_UPDATE (updating
a custom endpoint). In all cases, the name and policy access information is
stored in items of type KDBUS_ITEM_NAME and KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS. For this
transport, the following rules apply.

  * An item of type KDBUS_ITEM_NAME must be followed by at least one
    KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS item
  * An item of type KDBUS_ITEM_NAME can be followed by an arbitrary number of
    KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS items
  * An arbitrary number of groups of names and access levels can be passed

uids and gids are internally always stored in the kernel's view of global ids,
and are translated forth and back on the ioctl level accordingly.


11.2 Wildcard names
-------------------

Policy holder connections may upload names that contain the wildcard suffix
(".*"). That way, a policy can be uploaded that is effective for every
well-kwown name that extends the provided name by exactly one more level.

For example, if an item of a set up uploaded policy rules contains the name
"foo.bar.*", both "foo.bar.baz" and "foo.bar.bazbaz" are valid, but
"foo.bar.baz.baz" is not.

Such wildcard entries are not allowed for custom endpoints.


11.3 Policy example
-------------------

For example, a set of policy rules may look like this:

  KDBUS_ITEM_NAME: str='org.foo.bar'
  KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS: type=USER, access=OWN, id=1000
  KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS: type=USER, access=TALK, id=1001
  KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS: type=WORLD, access=SEE
  KDBUS_ITEM_NAME: str='org.blah.baz'
  KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS: type=USER, access=OWN, id=0
  KDBUS_ITEM_POLICY_ACCESS: type=WORLD, access=TALK

That means that 'org.foo.bar' may only be owned by uid 1000, but every user on
the bus is allowed to see the name. However, only uid 1001 may actually send
a message to the connection and receive a reply from it.

The second rule allows 'org.blah.baz' to be owned by uid 0 only, but every user
may talk to it.


11.4 TALK access and multiple well-known names per connection
-------------------------------------------------------------

Note that TALK access is checked against all names of a connection.
For example, if a connection owns both 'org.foo.bar' and 'org.blah.baz', and
the policy database allows 'org.blah.baz' to be talked to by WORLD, then this
permission is also granted to 'org.foo.bar'. That might sound illogical, but
after all, we allow messages to be directed to either the name or a well-known
name, and policy is applied to the connection, not the name. In other words,
the effective TALK policy for a connection is the most permissive of all names
the connection owns.

If a policy database exists for a bus (because a policy holder created one on
demand) or for a custom endpoint (which always has one), each one is consulted
during name registry listing, name owning or message delivery. If either one
fails, the operation is failed with -ENOPERM.


12. Pool
===============================================================================

A pool for data received from the kernel is installed for every connection of
the bus, and is sized according to kdbus_cmd_hello.pool_size. It is accessed
when one of the following ioctls is issued:

  * KDBUS_CMD_MSG_RECV, to receive a message
  * KDBUS_CMD_NAME_LIST, to dump the name registry
  * KDBUS_CMD_CONN_INFO, to retrieve information on a connection

Internally, the pool is organized in slices, and implements a buddy system.
The offsets returned by either one of the aforementioned ioctls describe
offsets inside the pool. In order to make the slice available for subsequent
calls, KDBUS_CMD_FREE has to be called on the offset.

To access the memory, the caller is expected to mmap() it to its task, like
this:

  /*
   * POOL_SIZE has to be a multiple of PAGE_SIZE, and it must match the
   * value that was previously passed in the .pool_size field of struct
   * kdbus_cmd_hello.
   */

  buf = mmap(NULL, POOL_SIZE, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, conn_fd, 0);
